Cookbook
========

.. _cookbook-index:

pymicro tries to hide some of the complexity of vtk, manipulating 3d arrays and crystallographic structures but the code may remain complex sometimes. Each experiment is unique and may require more or less tweaking to get the desired result or 3d rendering. The cookbook gather some recipe for users to better understand how it works and how to adapt existing code. Recipes are much more detailed than examples shown in the galleries and represent complete studies from the initial data to the final result.
