    "Create, Manipulate and Visualize Images with SampleData\n",
    "==============================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to demonstrates the elementary steps to store, manipulate and visualize **images** with the `SampleData` data platform class of the `pymicro.core` package. By **images**, it is intended volumic data that is defined on a *regular grid* of *voxels* (3D) or *pixels* (2D). \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook, you will learn to:\n",
    "- Transfer data from `numpy` arrays to an `image_object` from the `pymicro.core.image` package\n",
    "- Create an Image group into a `SampleData` instance/file from an `image_object`\n",
    "- Add scalar, vector and tensor Fields into 2D and 3D Image groups from `numpy` arrays\n",
    "- Use Paraview to visualize the images\n",
    "\n",
    "*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SampleData` class automatically synchronizes a **HDF5** and a **XDMF** file with each instance. The **XDMF** file serve a visualization purpose, as it is readable by Paraview, an advanced rederer for 2D visualization of volumic data. Through this Notebook, you will be indicated at various points to use Paraview to display the data that you will produced while executing its cells. To open a `SampleData` file in Paraview, simply open the software and simply use it to open the **XDMF**. At this moment, Paraview may require you to chose a specific reader to parse the **XDMF** file. At this point, chose `XDMF Reader`, and all the volumic datasets (images, meshes and their associated fields) will be displayed.  \n",
    "<font color=red>WARNING: readers `Xdmf3ReaderS` and `Xdmf3ReaderT` do not properly parse `SampleData` files.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Array ordering conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this Notebook, you will manipulate and visualize images, volumic data defined on regular grids. To display an image, the **XDMF** format provide Paraview with three informations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The grid origin: coordinates of the first vertex of the voxels/pixels grid\n",
    "2. The grid spacing: the size of voxels/pixels constituting the image\n",
    "3. Data arrays: the values of the fields to display on the image grid of voxels/pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "The correspondance between voxels/pixels and the data arrays elements is therefore implicit. Paraview interprets them in the descending order of the fastest varying indices, starting with the field element dimensionality, and then the grid dimensions. The last grid dimension is forced to be the $z$ coordinate. When considering scalar fields, the field dimensionality array dimension can be omitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "SampleData default settings use `C` array ordering, *i.e.* the fastest varying index for arrays is the last one, the rightmost one. That means, that arrays contained in SampleData images will be interpreted by paraview as follows:\n",
    "- $\\text{array}[Z,Y,Dim]$ in the case of vector or tensor 2D fields\n",
    "- $\\text{array}[Z,Y]$ in the case of scalar 2D fields\n",
    "- $\\text{array}[Z,Y,X,Dim]$ in the case of vector or tensor 3D fields\n",
    "- $\\text{array}[Z,Y,X]$ in the case of scalar 3D fields\n",
